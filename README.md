ExceptionHandler is a Spring annotation that provides a mechanism to treat exceptions that are thrown during execution of handlers (Controller operations).  ControllerAdvice is an annotation introduced in Spring 3.2, and as the name suggests, is “Advice” for multiple controllers. It is used to enable a single ExceptionHandler to be applied to multiple controllers. by using @ExceptionHandler and @ControllerAdvice, we’ll be able to define a central point for treating exceptions and wrapping them up in an ApiError object with better organization than the default Spring Boot error handling mechanism.
